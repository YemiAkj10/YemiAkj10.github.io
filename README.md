## Projects

## 2D-CNN-for-Accurate-COVID-19-Diagnosis-Using-CT-Imaging
[2D-CNN-for-Accurate-COVID-19-Diagnosis-Using-CT-Imaging](https://github.com/YemiAkj10/2D-CNN-for-Accurate-COVID-19-Diagnosis-Using-CT-Imaging/blob/main/HW5_SUB2.ipynb)

Developed a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) for diagnosing COVID-19 using CT images to differentiate between infected and non-infected cases. The project involved modifying Resnet-18 or Resnet-50 architectures for binary classification. Implemented and compared two approaches: training the CNN from scratch with random weights and utilizing transfer learning with pretrained weights, achieving accuracy targets of â‰¥90% for both methods. Visualized model performance using CAM methods (GradCAM and EigenCAM) to provide insights into model decision-making. The project demonstrated the effectiveness of transfer learning in medical image classification and delivered clear visualizations to enhance model interpretability

### ECG Peak identification and Classification

[ECG Classification and HyperParameters](https://github.com/YemiAkj10/ECG-Classification)

This project utilizes machine learning models like KNearest Neighbours, Decision Tree Classifiers, Linear Regression, and Random Forest Regressors to analyze ECG data. By leveraging these techniques, we aim to uncover patterns in the data and develop predictive models for cardiac health. This research not only contributes valuable insights to cardiology but also provides practical experience for potential internships in healthcare or biomedical industries.

### PCA Generative Faces
[PCA Faces Generative Model](https://github.com/YemiAkj10/PCA_Generative_Faces/blob/main/PCA_Faces_Generative_Model.ipynb)

In this project, we have demonstrated the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to explore the structure of face data. By reducing the dimensionality of the dataset and visualizing the principal components, we have gained insights into the underlying variations in facial features. This project highlights the utility of PCA in understanding high-dimensional data and provides valuable insights into the structure of human faces.

[Hyper Parameters Evaluation](https://github.com/YemiAkj10/Project_Housing_Price/blob/main/MachineLearningModels_Accuracy_Evaluation.ipynb)

This project focuses on predicting housing prices using advanced machine learning algorithms such as KNearest Neighbours, Decision Tree Classifiers, Linear Regression, and Random Forest Regressors. We meticulously evaluate hyperparameters to optimize model performance and emphasize effective data preprocessing techniques to enhance data quality. Through our research, we aim to provide accurate predictions for the housing market, facilitating informed decision-making in real estate.

### SuperMaid_Database (Construction and deployment)
[Database](https://github.com/YemiAkj10/SuperMaid_Database)

In this project, I utilized SQL to design and populate a database tailored to a specific domain. Leveraging SQL's querying capabilities, I extracted valuable insights from the dataset through intricate queries. Additionally, I employed Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) to visually represent the database structure. Through this project, I showcased proficiency in SQL, database design, and visualization techniques, underscoring the transformative potential of structured data across diverse domains.

### Parkinsons-Linear-Regression

[Markdown](https://github.com/YemiAkj10/Parkinsons-Linear-Regression/blob/main/docs/index.html)

This project leveraged RStudio to construct a linear regression model using data pertaining to Parkinson's disease. Beginning with data importation and preprocessing within RStudio, I performed exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics. Subsequently, I developed and fine-tuned a linear regression model to predict relevant outcomes associated with Parkinson's disease progression. Through this endeavor, I showcased proficiency in data analysis, statistical modeling, and R programming within the RStudio environment, underscoring its utility in biomedical research and clinical applications.
